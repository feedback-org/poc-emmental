# poc-emmental

Why emmental ? Take a quick look in the code, there are some `*TBW*` holes in the scripts... This is where critical code needs `To Be Written` to make the application working.


## Task 1 : poc-docker

The goal of the task is to build a docker postgres flask environment to setup all the development application.

After you are finished filling the `*TBW*` holes, you should have an API ready to be used and some managed scripts can be written to also interact (through flask_script cli) with the running container. 

One should be able to go to your `poc-docker` branch of your repository and do successfully these commands:

  1. `./poc start` making the docker containers run and the Flask Api to be available at localhost:80,

  2. on anther shell, `curl localhost:80/health` returning a json object specifying if the database is ok but with no user data in it for now,

  3. `./poc sandbox` making the app write one user in the database

  4. again, `curl localhost:80/health` should now return database is okay with some users,

  5. `./poc psql` helps to go inside a postgres psql process and `SELECT * from "user"` returns one object,

  6. `./poc python` helps to go inside an api python process and `from models.user import User;User.query.all()` returns the same user object through a sqlalchemy instance.
